# Correlation

Correlation is a way of measuring the extent to which two variables are related. This means we need to analyse whether as one variable increases, the other

* (1) increases,
* (2) decreases or
* (3) stays the same.

This can be done by calculating the covariance or correlation of two variables.

In this [Correlation Tutorial in R](https://github.com/kirenz/correlation/blob/master/Correlation.md), we will use a small dataset to illustrate the concepts of covariance and correlation. You may also download the [Rmarkdown file](https://github.com/kirenz/correlation/blob/master/Correlation.Rmd) and open it in RStudio.
