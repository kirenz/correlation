# Correlation

Correlation is a way of measuring the extent to which two variables are related. This means we need to analyse whether as one variable increases, the other

(1) increases,
(2) decreases or
(3) stays the same.

This can be done by calculating the covariance or correlation of two variables.

In this [Correlation Tutorial in R](https://github.com/kirenz/correlation/blob/master/Correlation.md), we will use a small dataset to illustrate the concepts of covariance and correlation.
